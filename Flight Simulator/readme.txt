The program is built thtough Visual Studio, Windows7. 


Running the Program.

1. DemoOpenGLVS10 (Microsoft Visual Studio Solution) file should be opened.

2. Next hit F7 on keyboard to "build" it.

3. Then hit ctrl+F5 to run the program.


ก็,กๆ arrow keys are to roll left right.
ก่,ก้ arrow keys are to pitch up and down.

roll and pitch actions have limited speed so that the plane should be controlled easily.

Thank you.
